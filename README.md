A YOLOv7X model has been trained using the dataset and achieved a mAP of 99.6%. You can access the trained weights through [this link](https://huggingface.co/alikhalilit98/Cattle-Body-Parts-Dataset-for-Object-Detection/blob/main/yolov7_cattle_parts_final.pt).

<!--
### Acquisition
The dataset creation involved the following steps:

- **Initial Data:** Images were collected and annotated to create a base dataset for training.
- **Model Training:** A [YOLOv7](https://github.com/WongKinYiu/yolov7) model was trained to recognize target objects in the annotated images.
- **Data Acquisition Script:** An automated script fetched videos from the internet.
- **Conversion and Filtering:** Videos were turned into frames; similar frames were filtered out using Cosine Similarity.
- **Object Detection:** The trained model identified objects in the new images.
- **Quality Check:** A comprehensive review ensured dataset accuracy and consistency.

### Annotation Format
Each annotation file corresponds to an image in the dataset and is formatted as per the [LabelMe](https://github.com/wkentaro/labelme) [JSON](https://www.json.org/json-en.html) standard. These annotations define the bounding box coordinates for each labeled body part, enabling straightforward integration into object detection pipelines.
