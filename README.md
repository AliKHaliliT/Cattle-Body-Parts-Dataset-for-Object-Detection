# Cattle Body Parts Image Dataset for Object Detection

## Intro
This dataset is a curated collection of images featuring various cattle body parts aimed at facilitating object detection tasks. The dataset contains a total of 428 high-quality photos, meticulously annotated with three distinct classes: "Back," "Head," and "Leg."

The dataset can be downloaded using [this link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alikhalilit98/cattle-body-parts-dataset-for-object-detection). The dataset is also available at Roboflow Universe. 

A YOLOv7X model has been trained using the dataset, and you can access the trained weights through [this link](trained_model_weights/).

### Acquisition
The dataset creation involved the following steps:

- **Initial Data:** Images were collected and annotated to create a base dataset for training.
- **Model Training:** A [YOLOv7](https://github.com/WongKinYiu/yolov7) model was trained to recognize target objects in the annotated images.
- **Data Acquisition Script:** An automated script fetched videos from the internet.
- **Conversion and Filtering:** Videos were turned into frames; similar frames were filtered out using Cosine Similarity.
- **Object Detection:** The trained model identified objects in the new images.
- **Quality Check:** A comprehensive review ensured dataset accuracy and consistency.

## Motivation
Accurate and reliable identification of different cattle body parts is crucial for various agricultural and veterinary applications. This dataset aims to provide a valuable resource for researchers, developers, and enthusiasts working on object detection tasks involving cattle, ultimately contributing to advancements in livestock management, health monitoring, and related fields.

### Annotation Format
Each annotation file corresponds to an image in the dataset and is formatted as per the [LabelMe](https://github.com/wkentaro/labelme) [JSON](https://www.json.org/json-en.html) standard. These annotations define the bounding box coordinates for each labeled body part, enabling straightforward integration into object detection pipelines.
